# VUBot
A script to post `Quizzes`, `GDBs`, and `Assignments` in Discord channel via WebHooks to alert the assignee. 

### Features
- Fetching Student's assigned `GDBs`, `Quizzes` and `Assignments`
- From (v1.2), we get any **pending challans'** as well! ðŸ˜„
- Posting all that stuff in a `Discord channel`

### How it works?
The script utilizies `Web Applications` source from VULMS. First it authenticates the user with his `studentId` and `studentPassword` and then creates and maintains a `session`. Utilizing that `session`, it accesses the **ActivityCalendar.aspx** file and gets the `JSON` containing the all data related to assigned stuff.

### How to use?
Add `user's credentials` and `WebHook URL` of the Discord channel in the [config.json](https://github.com/Anon-Exploiter/VUBot/blob/main/config.json) file (it already has test data in it -- just populate it)

With docker:
```bash
docker run uexpl0it/vubot:0.1 username pswd webhookURL
```

After doing so, upload the script on **Heroku**, `requirements`, `Procfile`, and `runtime.txt` has already been added. You can either run the script on some other `EC2 instance` (which constantly runs) or on Heroku and configure Dyno to constantly run (recommended and free way).
